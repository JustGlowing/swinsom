\paragraph{Data Set Used}
The solar wind data used in this work was obtained by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft, during a period of 14 years, between 1998 and 2011. The data can be downloaded from the \href{ftp://mussel.srl.caltech.edu/pub/ace/level2/multi}{FTP servers of The ACE Science Center (ASC)}. The files in this repository correspond to a compilation of hourly average data from three instruments: MAG (Magnetometer), SWEPAM (Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor) and EPAM (Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor). A detailed description of the entries in this data set can be found in the \href{http://www.srl.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/dib/rundibviewmultil2/ACE/ASC/DATA/level2/multi}{ASC website} listed in section \ref{sec:repos}.

A total of 122712 data points are available. However, routine maintenance operations, low statistics, instrument saturation and instrument degradation produce gaps and errors in the data. The SWICS data includes a flag assessing the quality of the calculated plasma moments. We retain only \'Good quality\' entries. Fig.\ref{fig:datacoverage} shows the final number of items retained per year. Our final data set contains a total of 72454 points.
