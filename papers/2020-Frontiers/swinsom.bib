abstract = {Space based technological systems are affected by the space weather in
many ways. Several severe failures of satellites have been reported at
times of space storms. Our society also increasingly depends on
satellites for communication, navigation, exploration, and research.
Predictions of the conditions in the satellite environment have
therefore become very important. We will here present predictions made
with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as
artificial neural networks (ANN) and hybrids of AT methods. We are
developing a space weather model based on intelligence hybrid systems
(IHS). The model consists of different forecast modules, each module
predicts the space weather on a specific time-scale. The time-scales
range from minutes to months with the fundamental time-scale of 1-5
minutes, 1-3 hours, 1-3 days, and 27 days. Solar and solar wind data are
used as input data. From solar magnetic field measurements, either made
on the ground at Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) at Stanford, or made
from space by the satellite SOHO, solar wind parameters can be predicted
and modelled with ANN and MHD models. Magnetograms from WSO are
available on a daily basis. However, from SOHO magnetograms will be
available every 90 minutes. SOHO magnetograms as input to ANNs will
therefore make it possible to even predict solar transient events.
Geomagnetic storm activity can today be predicted with very high
accuracy by means of ANN methods using solar wind input data. However,
at present real-time solar wind data are only available during part of
the day from the satellite WIND. With the launch of ACE in 1997, solar
wind data will on the other hand be available during 24 hours per day.
The conditions of the satellite environment are not only disturbed at
times of geomagnetic storms but also at times of intense solar radiation
and highly energetic particles. These events are associated with
increased solar activity. Predictions of these events are therefore also
handled with the modules in the Lund Space Weather Model. Interesting

During the last decade, sky surveys across the electromagnetic spectrum have collected hundreds of terabytes of astronomical data for hundreds of millions of sources. Over the next decade, the data volume will enter the petabyte domain, and provide accurate measurements for billions of sources. Astronomy and physics students are not traditionally trained to handle such voluminous and complex data sets. In this paper we describe astroML; an initiative, based on python and scikit-learn, to develop a compendium of machine learning tools designed to address the statistical needs of the next generation of students and astronomical surveys.

abstract = {In modern astrophysics, the machine learning has increasingly gained more popularity with its incredibly powerful ability to make predictions or calculated suggestions for large amounts of data. We describe an application of the supervised machine-learning algorithm, random forests (RF), to the star/galaxy/QSO classification and the stellar effective temperature regression based on the combination of LAMOST and SDSS spectroscopic data. This combination enable us to obtain reliable predictions with one of the largest training sample ever used. The training samples are built with nine-color data set of about three million objects for the classification and seven-color data set of over one million stars for the regression. The performance of the classification and regression is examined with the validation and the blind tests on the objects in the RAVE, 6dFGS, UVQS and APOGEE surveys. We demonstrate that the RF is an effective algorithm with the classification accuracies higher than 99$\backslash${\%} for the stars and the galaxies, and higher than 94$\backslash${\%} for the QSOs. These accuracies are higher than the machine-learning results in the former studies. The total standard deviations of the regression are smaller than 200 K that is similar to those of some spectrum-based methods. The machine-learning algorithm with the broad-band photometry provides us a more efficient approach to deal with massive amounts of astrophysical data than traditional color-cuts and SED fit.},

abstract = {Star-formation activity is a key property to probe the structure formation and hence characterise the large-scale structures of the universe. This information can be deduced from the star formation rate (SFR) and the stellar mass (M ), both of which, but especially the SFR, are very complex to estimate. Determining these quantities from UV, optical, or IR luminosities relies on complex modeling and on priors on galaxy types. We propose a method based on the machine-learning algorithm Random Forest to estimate the SFR and the M of galaxies at redshifts in the range 0.01 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.3, independent of their type. The machine-learning algorithm takes as inputs the redshift, WISE luminosities, and WISE colours in near-IR, and is trained on spectra-extracted SFR and M from the SDSS MPA-JHU DR8 catalogue as outputs. We show that our algorithm can accurately estimate SFR and M with scatters of $\sigma$SFR = 0.38 dex and $\sigma$M = 0.16 dex for SFR and stellar mass, respectively, and that it is unbiased with respect to redshift or galaxy type. The full-sky coverage of the WISE satellite allows us to characterise the star-formation activity of all galaxies outside the Galactic mask with spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0.01 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.3. The method can also be applied to photometric-redshift catalogues, with best scatters of $\sigma$SFR = 0.42 dex and $\sigma$M = 0.24 dex obtained in the redshift range 0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.3.},

In this study, we take two partially matched catalogues where one of the two catalogues has a large positional uncertainty. The two catalogues we used here were taken from the Hi Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) and SuperCOSMOS optical survey. Previous work had matched 44 per cent (1887 objects) of HIPASS to the SuperCOSMOS catalogue.A supervised learning algorithm was then applied to construct a model of the matched portion of our catalogue. Validation of the model shows that we achieved a good classification performance (99.12 per cent correct).Applying this model to the unmatched portion of the catalogue found 1209 new matches. This increases the catalogue size from 1887 matched objects to 3096. The combination of these procedures yields a catalogue that is 72 per cent matched.},

abstract = {We identify the coronal sources of the solar winds sampled by the ACE spacecraft during 1999 – 2008 and examine the in situ solar wind properties as a function of wind sources. The standard two-step mapping technique is adopted to establish the photospheric footpoints of the magnetic flux tubes along which the ACE winds flow. The footpoints are then placed in the context of EIT 284 {\AA} images and photospheric magnetograms, allowing us to categorize the sources into four groups: coronal holes (CHs), active regions (ARs), the quiet Sun (QS), and “undefined”. This practice also enables us to establish the response to solar activity of the fractions occupied by each type of solar wind, and of their speeds and O7+/O6+ ratios measured in situ. We find that during the maximum phase, the majority of ACE winds originate from ARs. During the declining phase, CHs and ARs are equally important contributors to the ACE solar winds. The QS contribution increases with decreasing solar activity and maximizes in the minimum phase when the QS appears to be the primary supplier of the ACE winds. With decreasing activity, the winds from all sources tend to become cooler, as represented by the increasingly low O7+/O6+ ratios. On the other hand, during each activity phase, the AR winds tend to be the slowest and are associated with the highest O7+/O6+ ratios, while the CH winds correspond to the other extreme, with the QS winds lying in between. Applying the same analysis method to the slow winds alone, here defined as the winds with speeds lower than 500 km s−1, we find basically the same overall behavior, as far as the contributions of individual groups of sources are concerned. This statistical study indicates that QS regions are an important source of the solar wind during the minimum phase.},

In front of the magnetosphere, a shock front was observed at which the solar wind was decelerated, heated and deflected around the magnetosphere.},

This paper reviews our current understanding of these interrelated problems: coronal heating and the acceleration of the ambient solar wind. We also discuss where the community stands in its ability to forecast how variations in the solar wind (i.e., fast and slow wind streams) impact the Earth. Although the last few decades have seen significant progress in observations and modeling, we still do not have a complete understanding of the relevant physical processes, nor do we have a quantitatively precise census of which coronal structures contribute to specific types of solar wind. Fast streams are known to be connected to the central regions of large coronal holes. Slow streams, however, appear to come from a wide range of sources, including streamers, pseudostreamers, coronal loops, active regions, and coronal hole boundaries. Complicating our understanding even more is the fact that processes such as turbulence, stream-stream interactions, and Coulomb collisions can make it difficult to unambiguously map a parcel measured at 1 AU back down to its coronal source. We also review recent progress—in theoretical modeling, observational data analysis, and forecasting techniques that sit at the interface between data and theory—that gives us hope that the above problems are indeed solvable.},

@article{Richardson2000,
abstract = {We assess the contribution of various types of solar wind structures (coronal mass ejections (CMEs), high-speed streams, and slow solar wind) to averages of the aa geomagnetic activity index ( ) during the solar cycle. We used solar wind plasma, magnetic field, and energetic particle data to identify the flow types present in the near-Earth solar wind during 1972?1986 (encompassing the decline of solar cycle 20 and all of cycle 21). Corotating high-speed streams contribute ? 70{\%} of outside of solar maximum and ? 30{\%} at solar maximum (1978?1982). CME-related structures (shocks/postshock flows/ejecta) account for ? 50{\%} of at solar maximum and {\textless}10{\%} outside of maximum. Slow solar wind contributes ? 20{\%} throughout the solar cycle. Our analysis provides insight into the cause of the so-called ?Gnevyshev Gap? in geomagnetic activity, characterized by a decrease in near the peak of the sunspot cycle. An example of this phenomenon occurred in 1980 at the maximum of cycle 21 when registered a value lower than that observed at the preceding solar minimum. We attribute the 1980 depression in to a temporary reduction in average solar wind speed, evident in both CME and corotating stream related components, and a reduction in mean magnetic fields in all types of solar wind structure. This involvement of all solar wind structures is indicative of a global solar phenomenon, apparently related to an observed depression in the solar open magnetic flux at the time of solar magnetic field polarity reversal. Both CMEs and streams contribute to geomagnetic activity on either side of this minimum. Thus, at least for cycle 21, the Gnevyshev Gap does not reflect a transition between a period of enhanced geomagnetic activity levels due to CMEs just prior to solar maximum and a second enhancement, due to corotating streams, during the descending phase. Beyond the post Gnevyshev Gap peak, high-speed streams will eventually dominate geomagnetic activity on the decline of the cycle and may, on occasion (as in solar cycle 20), produce a late peak in average geomagnetic activity with relatively little contribution from CMEs.},

abstract = {Solar wind near the heliospheric current sheet is investigated using Ulysses and ACE data in a superposed epoch analysis for several days on either side of the current sheets. Only data near sunspot minima are used, minimizing the influence of transients. New results are shown for composition and ionization state. Existing results showing a ?2 day wide depletion in He/H (He++/H+) at the current sheet are confirmed, although the depletion is generally more narrow. A recent finding of a broad 5?10 day wide reduction in He/H around the current sheet is also confirmed. An important result is that the narrow depletion is not a real phenomenon but is instead a statistical consequence of the superposition of transient depletions that also create the broad reduction in the averages. These transient depletions last from a few hours up to several days, come from the core of streamers, and are embedded in a quasi-steady flow from streamers' legs. Most depletions contain a current sheet just inside one edge, leading to the apparent narrow depletion at the current sheet in the superposed epoch analysis. These results lead us to a hypothesis for how the He/H depletions form with a current sheet just inside one edge. Fe/O fluctuations associated with the He/H fluctuations further show that mixing of plasma from coronal holes adjacent to streamer brightness boundaries into outflow inside the brightness boundary is not an important process.},

Coronal mass ejections associated with flares and/or eruptive prominences are another clearly identified source of solar wind, a transient component that accounts for approximately 5{\%} of the total solar mass loss. The role of other coronal structures in the generation of the solar wind is less clear. Streamers and the interfaces between streamers and other coronal regions are potential sources of low speed wind, a hypothesis consistent with existing observations. However, measurements of mass flows in these features are needed to confirm this. The necessary data can be obtained using recently developed remote sensing techniques, particularly if acquired in conjunction with Ulysses. Small-scale dynamical phenomena observed at the base of the corona (spicules, macrospicules and high speed jets) and small-scale structures observed in polar coronal holes (polar plumes) may or may not play a significant role in supplying mass, momentum and energy to the solar wind. New measurements are required to determine the role, if any, of small-scale structures in the generation of the solar wind.},

This in turn was followed by a region (magnetic cloud) in which the magnetic field vectors were observed to change by rotating nearly parallel to a plane, consistent with the passage of a magnetic loop. This loop extended at least 30° in longitude between 1 and 2 AU, and its radial dimension was approximately 0.5 AU. In the cloud the field strength was high, and the density and temperature were relatively low. Thus the dominant pressure in the cloud was that of the magnetic field. The total pressure inside the cloud was higher than outside, implying that the cloud was expanding as it moved outward, even at the distance of 2 AU. The momentum flux of the cloud at 2 AU was not higher than that of the preshock plasma, indicating that the cloud was not driving the shock at this distance. It is possible, however, that the shock was driven by the cloud closer to the sun where the cloud may have moved faster. An extraordinary filament was observed at the rear of the cloud. It was bounded by current sheets whose orientations were preserved over at least 0.12 AU and which were related to the plane of maximum variance of the magnetic field in the cloud.},

These effects are well described by the kinetic approaches where no closure requires the distributions to be nearly Maxwellian.

The heliospheric plasma sheet region is identified by a significantly enhanced plasma beta caused by density enhancements and diminished magnetic field strength and is about 20 to 30 times the thickness of the current sheet. The thickness of the heliospheric plasma sheet is found to increase exponentially with its average proton density. The heliospheric current sheet is often displaced to one edge or the other of the heliospheric plasma sheet. Further, the point of maximum plasma beta in the plasma sheet, where the magnetic field strength is at a broad local minimum, is not colocated with the heliospheric current sheet. Within the plasma sheet, changes in the magnetic pressure are balanced by corresponding changes in the plasma thermal pressure as expected for a convected solar wind feature. In addition, observations show small pressure differences between the regions upstream and downstream of the plasma sheet, which are interpreted as causing the plasma sheet to move across the spacecraft.},

The geoeffectiveness is evaluated using the geomagnetic indices Kp, AE, and Dst. We find that MCs are more geoeffective than IPSs, or CIRs. The average values of magnetic indices are significantly enhanced during disturbed periods associated with MCs, IPSs and CIRs, compared to the whole interval. The highest effect is noted for MC disturbed periods.Results obtained for the three data sets are used to derive a theoretical (continuous) probability distribution function (PDF) by fitting the histograms representing the percentage of events against the intervals of magnetic index. PDFs allow estimation of the probability of a given level of geomagnetic activity to be reached after the detection, by in situ solar wind observations, of a given interplanetary structure approaching the Earth. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Chen1997,
abstract = {This paper describes a feature-based pattern-recognition technique that utilizes real-time solar wind measurements to identify and predict the occurrence of solar wind structures that can cause geomagnetic storms. The technique is based on the knowledge that storms are caused by solar wind events with certain identifiable features, the two most important ones being (1) extended periods and (2) large amplitudes of southward interplanetary magnetic field (Bz {\textless} 0). Using the measured solar wind properties available at the current time t the profiles of the north-south magnetic field component, Bz(t) , and the east?west component, Bz(t) , are estimated for the solar wind that has yet to arrive, where t is the future time. On the basis of the estimated Bz and By profiles the occurrence, onset time, duration, and severity of impending storms are predicted. It is shown that the occurrence and durations of large storms exceeding a predetermined threshold can be predicted accurately. Successful predictions can be made after examining the initial ?20{\%} of a geoeffective (i.e., storm-causing) structure. For long-duration southward Bz events such as magnetic clouds the advance prediction time can be from several hours to in excess of 10 hours. The technique is tested using 5 months of historical solar wind data. We develop a procedure to extend the capability of the technique by incorporating additional features. Reduction of potential ?false alarms? and ?misses? resulting from such extensions is discussed.},

abstract = {This paper is a review of the basic theoretical dynamical properties of an atmosphere with an extended temperature strongly bound by gravity. The review begins with the historical developments leading up to the realization that the only dynamical equilibrium of an atmosphere with extended temperature is supersonic expansion. It is shown that sufficient conditions for supersonic expansion are T(r) declining asymptotically less rapidly than 1/r, or the density at the base of the corona being less than Nbgiven by (40) if no energy is available except through thermal conductivity, or the temperature falling within the limits given by (18) if T ∝ N$\alpha$-1 throughout the corona. Less extended temperatures lead to equilibria which are subsonic or static. The hypothetical case of a corona with no energy supply other than thermal conduction from its base is considered at some length because the equations may be solved by analytical methods and illustrate the transition from subsonic to supersonic equilibrium as the temperature becomes more extended. Comparison with the actual corona shows that the solar corona is actively heated for some distance into space by wave dissipation.},

In order to explain coronal and interplanetary heating, the microphysics of the dissipation of various forms of mechanical, electric and magnetic energy at small scales (e.g., contained in plasma waves, turbulences or non-uniform flows) must be addressed. We therefore scrutinise the basic assumptions underlying the classical transport theory and the related collisional heating rates, and also describe alternatives associated with wave-particle interactions. We elucidate the kinetic aspects of heating the solar corona and interplanetary plasma through Landau- and cyclotron-resonant damping of plasma waves, and analyse in detail wave absorption and micro instabilities. Important aspects (virtues and limitations) of fluid models, either single- and multi-species or magnetohydrodynamic and multi-moment models, for coronal heating and solar wind acceleration are critically discussed. Also, kinetic model results which were recently obtained by numerically solving the Vlasov-Boltzmann equation in a coronal funnel and hole are presented. Promising areas and perspectives for future research are outlined finally. {\textcopyright} Max Planck Society and the authors.},

In contrast the fast speed solar wind is characterized by its velocity of ?750 km s?1, its nearly photospheric composition and its frozen-in temperature of ?8 ? 105 K. The solar wind is believed to originate very close to the solar surface, but since it is accelerated significantly above the solar surface, its velocity cannot be correlated with remote observations to trace its origin. In contrast, elemental abundances and freeze-in temperatures can be used as tracers for locating the sources from which the slow and fast solar winds emerge. By comparing remote observations with properties of the solar wind observed in situ, the most likely structures from which solar wind plasmas emerge can be identified. In the present paper we review the current understanding of the morphological features present in the solar upper atmosphere and their physical properties such as electron temperature, electron density and elemental abundances. In addition, we discuss these observations in the context of recent theories describing the emergence of new magnetic flux to power the solar wind, and more traditional models that treat the background field and solar wind as a steady phenomenon.},

abstract = {During the solar minimum, when the Sun is at its least active, the solar wind1,2 is observed at high latitudes as a predominantly fast (more than 500 kilometres per second), highly Alfv{\'{e}}nic rarefied stream of plasma originating from deep within coronal holes. Closer to the ecliptic plane, the solar wind is interspersed with a more variable slow wind3 of less than 500 kilometres per second. The precise origins of the slow wind streams are less certain4; theories and observations suggest that they may originate at the tips of helmet streamers5,6, from interchange reconnection near coronal hole boundaries7,8, or within coronal holes with highly diverging magnetic fields9,10. The heating mechanism required to drive the solar wind is also unresolved, although candidate mechanisms include Alfv{\'{e}}n-wave turbulence11,12, heating by reconnection in nanoflares13, ion cyclotron wave heating14 and acceleration by thermal gradients1. At a distance of one astronomical unit, the wind is mixed and evolved, and therefore much of the diagnostic structure of these sources and processes has been lost. Here we present observations from the Parker Solar Probe15 at 36 to 54 solar radii that show evidence of slow Alfv{\'{e}}nic solar wind emerging from a small equatorial coronal hole. The measured magnetic field exhibits patches of large, intermittent reversals that are associated with jets of plasma and enhanced Poynting flux and that are interspersed in a smoother and less turbulent flow with a near-radial magnetic field. Furthermore, plasma-wave measurements suggest the existence of electron and ion velocity-space micro-instabilities10,16 that are associated with plasma heating and thermalization processes. Our measurements suggest that there is an impulsive mechanism associated with solar-wind energization and that micro-instabilities play a part in heating, and we provide evidence that low-latitude coronal holes are a key source of the slow solar wind.},

abstract = {We present a four-category classification algorithm for the solar wind, based on Gaussian Process. The four categories are the ones previously adopted in Xu {\&} Borovsky [2015]: ejecta, coronal hole origin plasma, streamer belt origin plasma, and sector reversal origin plasma. The algorithm is trained and tested on a labeled portion of the OMNI dataset. It uses seven inputs: the solar wind speed {\$}V{\_}{\{}sw{\}}{\$}, the temperature standard deviation {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}T{\$}, the sunspot number {\$}R{\$}, the {\$}f{\_}{\{}10.7{\}}{\$} index, the Alfven speed {\$}v{\_}A{\$}, the proton specific entropy {\$}S{\_}p{\$} and the proton temperature {\$}T{\_}p{\$} compared to a velocity-dependent expected temperature. The output of the Gaussian Process classifier is a four element vector containing the probabilities that an event (one reading from the hourly-averaged OMNI database) belongs to each category. The probabilistic nature of the prediction allows for a more informative and flexible interpretation of the results, for instance being able to classify events as 'undecided'. The new method has a median accuracy larger than {\$}90\backslash{\%}{\$} for all categories, even using a small set of data for training. The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and the reliability diagram also demonstrate the excellent quality of this new method. Finally, we use the algorithm to classify a large portion of the OMNI dataset, and we present for the first time transition probabilities between different solar wind categories. Such probabilities represent the 'climatological' statistics that determine the solar wind baseline.},

abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {Research in natural language processing proceeds, in part, by demonstrating that new models achieve superior performance (e.g., accuracy) on held-out test data, compared to previous results. In this paper, we demonstrate that test-set performance scores alone are insufficient for drawing accurate conclusions about which model performs best. We argue for reporting additional details, especially performance on validation data obtained during model development. We present a novel technique for doing so: expected validation performance of the best-found model as a function of computation budget (i.e., the number of hyperparameter search trials or the overall training time). Using our approach, we find multiple recent model comparisons where authors would have reached a different conclusion if they had used more (or less) computation. Our approach also allows us to estimate the amount of computation required to obtain a given accuracy; applying it to several recently published results yields massive variation across papers, from hours to weeks. We conclude with a set of best practices for reporting experimental results which allow for robust future comparisons, and provide code to allow researchers to use our technique.},

Starting from early approaches of magnification control in vector quantization, we then concentrate on different approaches for SOM and NG. We show that three structurally similar approaches can be applied to both algorithms that are localized learning, concave-convex learning, and winner-relaxing learning. Thereby, the approach of concave-convex learning in SOM is extended to a more general description, whereas the concave-convex learning for NG is new. In general, the control mechanisms generate only slightly different behavior comparing both neural algorithms. However, we emphasize that the NG results are valid for any data dimension, whereas in the SOM case, the results hold only for the one-dimensional case.},

In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large.

We pre-train the data with stacked denoising autoencoder, and to prevent units from co-adapting too much dropout is applied in the period of training.

abstract = {We summarize the occurrence of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) in the near-Earth solar wind during 1996-2002, corresponding to the increasing and maximum phases of solar cycle 23. In particular, we give a detailed list of such events. This list, based on in situ observations, is not confined to subsets of ICMEs, such as "magnetic clouds" or those preceded by "halo" coronal mass injections (CMEs) observed by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph, and provides an overview of 214 ICMEs in the near-Earth solar wind during this period. The ICME rate increases by about an order of magnitude from solar minimum to solar maximum (when the rate is ∼3 ICMEs per solar rotation period). The rate also shows a temporary reduction during 1999 and another brief, deeper reduction in late 2000 to early 2001, which only approximately track variations in the solar 10-cm flux. In addition, there are occasional periods of several rotations duration when the ICME rate is enhanced in association with high solar activity levels. We find an indication of a periodic variation in the ICME rate, with a prominent period of ∼165 days similar to that previously reported in various solar phenomena. It is found that the fraction of ICMEs that are magnetic clouds has a solar cycle variation, the fraction being larger near solar minimum. For the subset of events that we could associate with a CME at the Sun the transit speeds from the Sun to the Earth were highest after solar maximum.

In particular, solar wind composition and charge state observations are now considered when identifying the ICMEs. In general, these additional data confirm the earlier identifications based predominantly on other solar wind plasma and magnetic field parameters. However, the boundaries of ICME-like plasma based on charge state/composition data may deviate significantly from those based on conventional plasma/magnetic field parameters. Furthermore, the much studied "magnetic clouds", with flux-rope-like magnetic field configurations, may form just a substructure of the total ICME interval. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The composition of the solar wind can be used to determine its origin at the Sun; e.g., solar wind from coronal holes has demonstrably lower charge states than solar wind of other origins. The O7+/O6+ ratio as measured by Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) during 1998-2008 is used to divide the solar wind into three categories: non-transient solar wind from coronal holes (hereafter referred to as CHW); non-transient solar wind that originates from outside of coronal holes (hereafter referred to as NCHW), and solar wind associated with transient interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). The global distribution of the solar wind relative to the Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS), as specified by a Potential-Field-Source-Surface model, is then determined. The solar wind from outside of coronal holes is found to originate from a band of about 40° in width about the HCS during solar maximum conditions, and a much smaller band of {\textless} 17° during solar minimum. These results are consistent with models for the global transport of the solar magnetic field during the solar cycle, and they are consistent with earlier global flow structure determinations based upon velocity alone Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned. In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included. A hyperparameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task (PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single broad class of feed-forward vision architectures.},

abstract = {We use OMNI 1-minute resolution data sets from 1995 through 2017, covering about two consecutive solar cycles, to investigate the solar cycle dependence of various turbulence quantities and cosmic ray (CR) mean free paths. We employ quasi-linear theory (QLT) and nonlinear guiding center theory (NLGC) to evaluate the CR parallel and perpendicular diffusion. We find that in the ecliptic plane at 1 au (1) the fluctuating magnetic energy density z ±2, residual energy ED , and corresponding correlation functions all have an obvious solar cycle dependence. The residual energy ED is always negative, which indicates that the energy in magnetic fluctuations is larger than the energy in kinetic fluctuations, especially at solar maximum; (2) the correlation length $\lambda$ for magnetic fluctuations does not show significant solar cycle variation; (3) the temporally varying shear source of turbulence, which is most important in the inner heliosphere, depends on the solar cycle; and (4) high level turbulence will increase CR perpendicular diffusion and decrease CR parallel diffusion, but this trend can be masked if the background interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) changes in concert with turbulence in response to solar activity. These results provide quantitative inputs for both turbulence transport models and CR diffusion coefficient models.},

abstract = {The Els$\backslash$"{\{}a{\}}sser variables are often used in studies of plasma turbulence, in helping differentiate between MHD waves propagating parallel or anti-parallel to the main magnetic field. While for pure Alfv$\backslash$'en waves in a homogeneous plasma the method is strictly valid, we show that compressible, magnetoacoustic waves are in general described by both Els$\backslash$"{\{}a{\}}sser variables. Furthermore, in a compressible and inhomogeneous plasma, the pure MHD waves (Alfv$\backslash$'en, fast and slow) are no longer normal modes, but waves become linearly coupled or display mixed properties of Alfv$\backslash$'en and magnetoacoustic nature. These waves are necessarily described by both Els$\backslash$"{\{}a{\}}sser variables and therefore the Els$\backslash$"{\{}a{\}}sser formalism cannot be used to strictly separate parallel and anti-parallel propagating waves. Nevertheless, even in an inhomogeneous plasma, for a highly Alfv$\backslash$'enic wave the Els$\backslash$"{\{}a{\}}sser variable corresponding to the propagation direction appears still dominating. We suggest that for Alfv$\backslash$'enic waves, the relative amplitude of Els$\backslash$"{\{}a{\}}sser variables depends on the local degree of inhomogeneity and other plasma and wave properties. This finding has implications for turbulence studies in inhomogeneous and compressible plasmas, such as the solar corona and solar wind.},

abstract = {Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [1] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P(y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.},

The evolution of the PSP derived turbulent quantities are compared to the numerical solutions of the nearly incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (NI MHD) turbulence transport model recently developed by Zank et al.

On the basis of these comparisons, we derive other theoretical turbulent quantities, such as the energy in forward and backward propagating modes, the total turbulent energy, the normalized residual energy and cross-helicity, the fluctuating magnetic energy, and the correlation lengths corresponding to forward and backward propagating modes, the residual energy, and the fluctuating magnetic energy.},

abstract = {The first two orbits of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft have enabled the first in situ measurements of the solar wind down to a heliocentric distance of 0.17 au (or 36 Rs). Here, we present an analysis of this data to study solar wind turbulence at 0.17 au and its evolution out to 1 au. While many features remain similar, key differences at 0.17 au include: increased turbulence energy levels by more than an order of magnitude, a magnetic field spectral index of -3/2 matching that of the velocity and both Elsasser fields, a lower magnetic compressibility consistent with a smaller slow-mode kinetic energy fraction, and a much smaller outer scale that has had time for substantial nonlinear processing. There is also an overall increase in the dominance of outward-propagating Alfv$\backslash$'enic fluctuations compared to inward-propagating ones, and the radial variation of the inward component is consistent with its generation by reflection from the large-scale gradient in Alfv$\backslash$'en speed. The energy flux in this turbulence at 0.17 au was found to be {\~{}}10{\%} of that in the bulk solar wind kinetic energy, becoming {\~{}}40{\%} when extrapolated to the Alfv$\backslash$'en point, and both the fraction and rate of increase of this flux towards the Sun is consistent with turbulence-driven models in which the solar wind is powered by this flux.},

abstract = {Of all the activity observed on the Sun, two of the most energetic events are flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Usually, solar active regions that produce large flares will also produce a CME, but this is not always true. Despite advances in numerical modeling, it is still unclear which circumstances will produce a CME. Therefore, it is worthwhile to empirically determine which features distinguish flares associated with CMEs from flares that are not. At this time, no extensive study has used physically meaningful features of active regions to distinguish between these two populations. As such, we attempt to do so by using features derived from (1) photospheric vector magnetic field data taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory 's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument and (2) X-ray flux data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite's X-ray Flux instrument. We build a catalog of active regions that either produced both a flare and a CME (the positive class) or simply a flare (the negative class). We then use machine-learning algorithms to (1) determine which features distinguish these two populations, and (2) forecast whether an active region that produces an M- or X-class flare will also produce a CME. We compute the True Skill Statistic, a forecast verification metric, and find that it is a relatively high value of ∼0.8 ± 0.2. We conclude that a combination of six parameters, which are all intensive in nature, will capture most of the relevant information contained in the photospheric magnetic field.},

@article{Bobra2015,
abstract = {We attempt to forecast M-and X-class solar flares using a machine-learning algorithm, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), and four years of data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, the first instrument to continuously map the full-disk photospheric vector magnetic field from space. Most flare forecasting efforts described in the literature use either line-of-sight magnetograms or a relatively small number of ground-based vector magnetograms. This is the first time a large dataset of vector magnetograms has been used to forecast solar flares. We build a catalog of flaring and non-flaring active regions sampled from a database of 2,071 active regions, comprised of 1.5 million active region patches of vector magnetic field data, and characterize each active region by 25 parameters. We then train and test the machine-learning algorithm and we estimate its performances using forecast verification metrics with an emphasis on the True Skill Statistic (TSS). We obtain relatively high TSS scores and overall predictive abilities. We surmise that this is partly due to fine-tuning the SVM for this purpose and also to an advantageous set of features that can only be calculated from vector magnetic field data. We also apply a feature selection algorithm to determine which of our 25 features are useful for discriminating between flaring and non-flaring active regions and conclude that only a handful are needed for good predictive abilities.},
