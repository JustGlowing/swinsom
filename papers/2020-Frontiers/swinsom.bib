abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned. In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included. A hyperparameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task (PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single broad class of feed-forward vision architectures.},

abstract = {The composition of the solar wind can be used to determine its origin at the Sun; e.g., solar wind from coronal holes has demonstrably lower charge states than solar wind of other origins. The O7+/O6+ ratio as measured by Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) during 1998-2008 is used to divide the solar wind into three categories: non-transient solar wind from coronal holes (hereafter referred to as CHW); non-transient solar wind that originates from outside of coronal holes (hereafter referred to as NCHW), and solar wind associated with transient interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). The global distribution of the solar wind relative to the Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS), as specified by a Potential-Field-Source-Surface model, is then determined. The solar wind from outside of coronal holes is found to originate from a band of about 40° in width about the HCS during solar maximum conditions, and a much smaller band of {\textless} 17° during solar minimum. These results are consistent with models for the global transport of the solar magnetic field during the solar cycle, and they are consistent with earlier global flow structure determinations based upon velocity alone Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {We use OMNI 1-minute resolution data sets from 1995 through 2017, covering about two consecutive solar cycles, to investigate the solar cycle dependence of various turbulence quantities and cosmic ray (CR) mean free paths. We employ quasi-linear theory (QLT) and nonlinear guiding center theory (NLGC) to evaluate the CR parallel and perpendicular diffusion. We find that in the ecliptic plane at 1 au (1) the fluctuating magnetic energy density z ±2, residual energy ED , and corresponding correlation functions all have an obvious solar cycle dependence. The residual energy ED is always negative, which indicates that the energy in magnetic fluctuations is larger than the energy in kinetic fluctuations, especially at solar maximum; (2) the correlation length $\lambda$ for magnetic fluctuations does not show significant solar cycle variation; (3) the temporally varying shear source of turbulence, which is most important in the inner heliosphere, depends on the solar cycle; and (4) high level turbulence will increase CR perpendicular diffusion and decrease CR parallel diffusion, but this trend can be masked if the background interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) changes in concert with turbulence in response to solar activity. These results provide quantitative inputs for both turbulence transport models and CR diffusion coefficient models.},

@article{Akiba2019,
abstract = {The purpose of this study is to introduce new design-criteria for next-generation hyperparameter optimization software. The criteria we propose include (1) define-by-run API that allows users to construct the parameter search space dynamically, (2) efficient implementation of both searching and pruning strategies, and (3) easy-to-setup, versatile architecture that can be deployed for various purposes, ranging from scalable distributed computing to lightweight experiment conducted via interactive interface. In order to prove our point, we will introduce Optuna, an optimization software which is a culmination of our effort in the development of a next generation optimization software. As an optimization software designed with define-by-run principle, Optuna is particularly the first of its kind. We will present the design-techniques that became necessary in the development of the software that meets the above criteria, and demonstrate the power of our new design through experimental results and real world applications. Our software is available under the MIT license (https://github.com/pfnet/optuna/).},

@article{Bergstra2011,
abstract = {Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [1] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P(y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.},

@article{Chen2020,
abstract = {The first two orbits of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft have enabled the first in situ measurements of the solar wind down to a heliocentric distance of 0.17 au (or 36 Rs). Here, we present an analysis of this data to study solar wind turbulence at 0.17 au and its evolution out to 1 au. While many features remain similar, key differences at 0.17 au include: increased turbulence energy levels by more than an order of magnitude, a magnetic field spectral index of -3/2 matching that of the velocity and both Elsasser fields, a lower magnetic compressibility consistent with a smaller slow-mode kinetic energy fraction, and a much smaller outer scale that has had time for substantial nonlinear processing. There is also an overall increase in the dominance of outward-propagating Alfv$\backslash$'enic fluctuations compared to inward-propagating ones, and the radial variation of the inward component is consistent with its generation by reflection from the large-scale gradient in Alfv$\backslash$'en speed. The energy flux in this turbulence at 0.17 au was found to be {\~{}}10{\%} of that in the bulk solar wind kinetic energy, becoming {\~{}}40{\%} when extrapolated to the Alfv$\backslash$'en point, and both the fraction and rate of increase of this flux towards the Sun is consistent with turbulence-driven models in which the solar wind is powered by this flux.},
